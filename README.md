# MedLP---HAFB---CLIP
ABSTRACT—Fetal nervous system malformation screening is crucial for reducing birth defects, and ultrasound technology serves as a key prenatal screening tool. However, fetal ultrasound image classification confronts numerous challenges, including poor image quality, complex anatomical structures, data heterogeneity, and model limitations. This study presents the MedLP - HAFB - CLIP model. A prompt learner is designed to generate prompts matching anatomical categories, integrating medical knowledge. Fine - grained anatomical descriptions and customized loss functions are incorporated to enhance the model's discriminative ability for complex image features. Additionally, the HAFB module is introduced for multi - scale feature extraction and adaptive fusion, improving classification performance. Data processing methods such as oversampling and data standardization are also adopted. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms comparative models like Swin Transformer and EfficientNet in key metrics, including accuracy (0.993), precision (0.991), recall (0.992), and F1 - score (0.992), and it performs remarkably well in differentiating similar anatomical structure images, such as lateral ventricle transverse sections and thalamus transverse sections. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of the model components. Moreover, an observational experiment shows that the model has a 100% accuracy rate on its own and can improve the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy of radiologists with different levels of experience. This research provides an effective solution for fetal ultrasound image classification, and future work can further optimize the model by expanding the dataset and integrating emerging technologies.
